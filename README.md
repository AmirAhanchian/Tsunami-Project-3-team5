# Project Title: A Tsunami of Information: Exploring the Causes and Consequences of Tsunamis

Team Members: Amir Ahanchian, Endi Hajdari, Kevin Dai, Mary Toofani, Natasha Girdharry 

# Project Description
Natural disasters such as tsunamis pose a significant threat to coastal communities worldwide, with their destructive power causing the loss of life, injury, displacement, and significant damage to infrastructure and property. Tsunamis are generated by underwater earthquakes, landslides, or volcanic eruptions, and their waves can reach up to 30 meters high and exceed speeds of 500 m/hr, making them one of the deadliest natural disasters. The frequency and severity of tsunamis have increased over the years, leading to significant damage and loss of life worldwide. This research proposal aims to investigate the causes and mechanisms of tsunamis incidence and assess the environmental, social, and economic impacts of tsunamis on coastal communities. The study's findings will provide crucial insights into the incidence of tsunamis worldwide and their environmental, social, and economic impacts.

# Research Question(s)/Purpose

Question 1: What is the spatiotemporal pattern of tsunamis worldwide between the 1920s to early 2000s, including their frequency, geographic distribution, and main causes?

Question 2: What is the average height of tsunami waves and mortality of coastal communities?

There were no significant increases in Tsunami Frequency since the 1920s to early 2000s.

The main cause of a Tsunami is mostly earthquakes.

Japan has been the country that is the hardest hit by Tsunamis likely due to it's geographical location on the earthquake beltline.

4 layered interactive mapping including tsunami maximum water height (m), tsunami  RunUps (m), total deaths, and an overlay of tectonic plates to provide 4 unique viewpoints.

The median deaths from a tsunami are 27 (IQR = 159)  with the largest amount of deaths (142,806) occurring in Japan in 1923.

The median maximum water height of a tsunami is 0.9m (IQR = 2.8m) and the largest water height in our dataset was of 524.6 m  that occurred in 1958 in Alaska.

The median run-ups are 5 m(IQR = 15m) where even a run-up of 1m is considered dangerous (5). 

# Limitations and Challenges 

We had a small sample size of 285 data points so we cannot determine that this data is representative of all tsunamis worlwide, and we only included 31 countries, and had data between 1920s to early 2000s. We also had many null values so we assumed averages for some data points (earthquake magnitude, intensity, water height, and total deaths) so this data may not be representative of cu
Unrepresentative of the effect on coastal communities today. 


# Conclusions: 
The amount of Tsunamis since the early 1920s has not significantly changed. 

Majority of Tsunamis occur due to Earthquakes. 

27% of tsunamis occurred in Japan.  

The median deaths from a tsunami are 27 (IQR = 159)  with the largest amount of deaths (142,806) occurring in Japan in 1923.  

The median maximum water height of a tsunami is 0.9m (IQR = 2.8m) and the largest water height in our dataset was of 524.6 m  that occurred in 1958 in Alaska. 

The median run-ups are 5 m(IQR = 15m) where even a run-up of 1m is considered dangerous (5).
