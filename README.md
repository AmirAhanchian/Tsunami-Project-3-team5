# Project Title: Investigating the Causes and Impacts of Tsunami Incidence on Coastal Communities Worldwide 

Team Members: Amir Ahanchian, Endi Hajdari, Kevin Dai, Mary Toofani, Natasha Girdharry 

# Project Outline
Natural disasters such as tsunamis pose a significant threat to coastal communities worldwide, with their destructive power causing the loss of life, injury, displacement, and significant damage to infrastructure and property. Tsunamis are generated by underwater earthquakes, landslides, or volcanic eruptions, and their waves can reach up to 30 meters high and exceed speeds of 500 km/hr, making them one of the deadliest natural disasters. The frequency and severity of tsunamis have increased over the years, leading to significant damage and loss of life worldwide. This research proposal aims to investigate the causes and mechanisms of tsunamis incidence and assess the environmental, social, and economic impacts of tsunamis on coastal communities. The study's findings will provide crucial insights into the incidence of tsunamis worldwide and their environmental, social, and economic impacts.

# Research Question(s)/Purpose
How has the incidence of tsunamis worldwide changed over time? What are the environmental, social, and economic impacts of these events on coastal communities, including injury and mortality rates, displacement, and damage to infrastructure and property? 

Datasets link: 

Data Type (surveys, financial dataset, etc.): Global data for tsunamis 

# Visualizations: interactive timeline, map, tsunami count by country, bar-chart intensity 

# Project Requirements: 
Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
