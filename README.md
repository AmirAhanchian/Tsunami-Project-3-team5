# Tsunami-Project

Project Title: Investigating the Causes and Impacts of Tsunami Incidence on Coastal Communities Worldwide 

Team Members: Amir Ahanchian, Endi Hajdari, Kevin Dai, Mary Toofani, Natasha Girdharry 

Project Outline: Natural disasters such as tsunamis pose a significant threat to coastal communities worldwide, with their destructive power causing the loss of life, injury, displacement, and significant damage to infrastructure and property. Tsunamis are generated by underwater earthquakes, landslides, or volcanic eruptions, and their waves can reach up to 30 meters high and exceed speeds of 500 km/hr, making them one of the deadliest natural disasters. The frequency and severity of tsunamis have increased over the years, leading to significant damage and loss of life worldwide. This research proposal aims to investigate the causes and mechanisms of tsunamis incidence and assess the environmental, social, and economic impacts of tsunamis on coastal communities. The study's findings will provide crucial insights into the incidence of tsunamis worldwide and their environmental, social, and economic impacts.

Research Question(s)/Purpose: How has the incidence of tsunamis worldwide changed over time? What are the environmental, social, and economic impacts of these events on coastal communities, including injury and mortality rates, displacement, and damage to infrastructure and property?

Data Type (surveys, financial dataset, etc.): Global data for tsunamis 

Visualizations: interactive timeline, map, tsunami count by country, bar-chart intensity 

Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 

Project Requirements: 
Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

Natasha Gâ€™s Potential Databases: 
Carotid artery stenosis patients 
Project Outline: The aim of our research project is to investigate the potential use of protein biomarkers for diagnosing coronary artery stenosis (CAS), a condition where the arteries supplying blood to the heart are narrowed, leading to reduced blood flow and an increased risk of heart attack. While several proteins, such as troponin, C-reactive protein (CRP), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), and Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase (Lp-PLA2), have been identified as potential biomarkers for CAS, no single biomarker has been found to definitively diagnose the condition. Our project seeks to identify a specific protein biomarker that can be used for the diagnosis of CAS. To achieve this, we will review available research on protein biomarkers and analyze relevant data from clinical evaluation, imaging tests, and blood biomarkers. Ultimately, our research may provide important insights into the development of more accurate diagnostic tools for CAS, helping to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of heart disease.

Research Question(s)/Purpose: What proteins can be used as biomarkers for coronary artery stenosis?

Mental Health Disorders among adolescents in the US 
Project Outline: The goal of this research project is to estimate the prevalence of mental health disorders among children and adolescents in the United States and to identify demographic factors, such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity, that may be associated with increased risk. We will use data from the National Survey of Children's Health, which is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and provides a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents aged 0-17 years. Our analysis will focus on the prevalence of common mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and will also examine the co-occurrence of multiple disorders. We will identify factors that are most strongly associated with risk of mental health disorders, and will explore potential differences in risk by demographic factors. The results of this study will provide important insights into the burden of mental health disorders among children and adolescents in the United States and may help inform the development of targeted interventions and policies to improve mental health outcomes for this population.

Research Question(s)/Purpose: What is the prevalence of mental health disorders among children and adolescents in the United States? and how does this vary by demographic factors such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity?
